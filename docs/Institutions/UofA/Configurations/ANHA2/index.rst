ANHA2
=====

ANHA is our acronym for the Arctic and Northern Hemisphere Atlantic configuration of the NEMO model. It covers the entire Arctic and Northern Atlantic Ocean, and a portion of the Southern Atlantic. The ANHA configuration has open boundaries across Bering Strait in the Arctic, as well as in the Southern Atlantic Ocean across the 20 degree south latitude. ANHA was designed to be a subset of the ORCA global grid, allowing us to use a regional configuration to use much less computing resources (RAM + CPU time) to carry out our research and development purposes.

ANHA2 is our very low resolution regional configuration that affords us low cost simulations, ones we could run for very lengthy periods of time.
