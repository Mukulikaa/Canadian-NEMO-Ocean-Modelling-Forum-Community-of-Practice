Troubleshooting
===============

Nothing works 100% of the time. If you are here, you probably are having a bit of difficulty requesting our model data. If step 1 and 2 do not work, see the manual email method of step 3. Or just contact our Admin's, we can sort things out easily enough

1: The data request link opens up windows mail instead of what I prefer
If you are using a Windows PC, the link sends the email request to use the default mail app. Your default is set to Windows Mail.
To change this, click on the windows button in the bottom left corner. Search for "apps" and select "apps and features". This will bring up a new page
On this page, on the left side, select 'Default Apps'. You should now see a new screen which shows your default apps for certain tasks. For "Email" this may not be what you want
Feel free to adjust this to Google Chrome to use that internet browser (and its associated email program)

2: The data request link opens a new page but it is empty
This is a result of the email protocol handlers not functioning like we want them to. See `This Page <https://www.timeatlas.com/email-links-chrome-gmail/>`_, specifically step 1 and 2.

3: Still cannot get it to work:
At this point, you should just be able to copy the below and send it to our admin. The link automatically includes some infomation within [] so it would be very helpful if you could fill those in below as well.

Email to: pennelly AT ualberta.ca and nemouofa AT gmail.com
