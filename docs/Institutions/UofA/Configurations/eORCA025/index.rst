eORCA025
========

eORCA025 is a global configuration with a horizontal resolution of 1/4 of a degree. It is an extended version of the original ORCA configuration, now fully containing the world's ocean. The University of Alberta started setting up our global simulations in 2021 after over a decade of regional modelling.

Going global allows us to branch our research out, exploring aspects which were not possible with our suite of regional Arctic/Atlantic simulations. The global simulations are relatively new to us and only a handful of simulations have been planned so far:

A single movie is shown below showing different aspects of the 4 eORCA025 simulations. More to come once the simulations finish and analysis is carried out.
