Or click `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19qEFmjSxgwy_TDJE5fn-0hx-fpYK_gjRlGIeV5NsqfY/edit?usp=sharing>`_ to access the google sheet of our runs. This sheet doesn't contain the pictures/movies/figures/detailed description that the above links contain. All of the above links contain portions of this master sheet, although they are shown in ReadTheDocs' tables which are smaller and a bit more difficult to read. This sheet also contains the manner by which you can request model output data; see the far right columns.
