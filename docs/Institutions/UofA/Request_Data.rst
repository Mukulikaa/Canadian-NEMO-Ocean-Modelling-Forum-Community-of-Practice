Request Model Data
==================

We are happy to share the output/data/forcing for our ocean simulations- in fact we often have more data than we can look at ourselves. Anyone who is interested in our various model simulations should take a look at our `configuration page <https://canadian-nemo-ocean-modelling-forum-commuity-of-practice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Institutions/UofA/Configurations/index.html>`_ or our `simulation tables <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19qEFmjSxgwy_TDJE5fn-0hx-fpYK_gjRlGIeV5NsqfY/edit#gid=0>`_. We have a spot on the far right of the table for you to request a particular set of model output- click that link and follow the instructions. While we do not have the same setup for the forcing data (Atmospheric conditions, runoff, iceberg, biogeochemical, tracers, etc.), feel free to reach out to us if you are interested. If you have questions, contact professor Paul Myers (pmyers AT ualberta.ca) with your questions and we will get back to you.
