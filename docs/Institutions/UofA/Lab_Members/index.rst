* Clark Pennelly: I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow with Paul Myers, where I spend most of my time developing new NEMO model configurations, updating our lab to newer NEMO versions,  building this website, and addressing any issues our lab members have with NEMO. I finished my PhD on modelling stratification within the Labrador Sea with Paul Myers in 2021, and before that I worked with Paul as a research assistant, setting up and carrying out numerical simulations using the AGRIF nesting software

* Nathan Grivault: I was a PhD student, and briefly a post-doc, under Paul Myers supervision. My main research focus was the freshwater fluxes out of the Arctic towards the northern Atlantic region, and in particular the role of Baffin Bay and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Currently working as a geophysical developer at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) in the Oceanographic Research unit.
