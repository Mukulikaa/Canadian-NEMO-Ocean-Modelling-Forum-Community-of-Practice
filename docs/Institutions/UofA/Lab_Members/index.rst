* Clark Pennelly: I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow with Paul Myers, where I spend most of my time developing new NEMO model configurations, updating our lab to newer NEMO versions,  building this website, and addressing any issues our lab members have with NEMO. I finished my PhD on modelling stratification within the Labrador Sea with Paul Myers in 2021, and before that I worked with Paul as a research assistant, setting up and carrying out numerical simulations using the AGRIF nesting software
