NEMO is the ocean modelling framework used at the University of Alberta. Spearheaded by professor `Paul G. Myers <mailto:pmyers@ualberta.ca>`_ within the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences department, we carry out ocean simulations, further develop the NEMO model, and perform scientific research across primarily the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans.
