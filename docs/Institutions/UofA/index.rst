=====================

NEMO is the ocean modelling framework used at the University of Alberta. Spearheaded by professor Paul G. Myers within the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences department, his team of interns, undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral scholars carry out ocean simulations, further develop the NEMO model, and perform scientific research across primarily the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans.
