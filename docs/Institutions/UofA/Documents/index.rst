Documents
---------

This is a list of documents which are useful for our lab members. This is a list of tutorials with step-by-step actions to do several tasks that might be required during your Master/PhD/Internship. Be aware that they probably contain typos. Moreover, it is always based on an example scenario, you have to understand and adapt the tutorial to your case. Be aware that these tutorials have been written ages ago by one or several students that might not be around anymore and that might not be aware of changes that the group did to the processes and scripts.

Do not copy/paste the command without understanding what you’re doing. If you don’t understand, ask. You’ll do yourself more harm by copy/pasting and then fixing the issues than asking first.

Most documents are automatically accessible from a UofA Google account.
