Matlab Colormaps
===============

There are a lot of color maps availalbe using the NCLcolormap script within matlab:
load nclcolormap

I've made a document on what they all look like. Right click to open in a new page so you can scroll/zoom easier. Find one you like and use it by typing
|
colormap(nclcolormap.{NAME})
|
where NAME is shown undernearth the horizontal colorbar on the figure below.
