"Baffin Bay Annual Freshwater Content and Budget" 
.................................................
Baffin Bay significantly contributes to transporting and transforming freshwater from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, our understanding remains incomplete regarding the mechanisms involved in storing and dispersing of the this freshwater within the bay before it leaves through Davis Strait. In order to investigate the freshwater content (FWC) seasonal variability in Baffin Bay, we used NEMO 3.6 model coupled with The Louvain-La-Neuve sea ice model (LIM2) - 1/4º horizontal spatial resolution. We have analyzed the FWC annual budget within Baffin Bay and determined that there is a surplus of freshwater into the bay from May to September, while there is a FWC decrease in the remaining months. After considering all sources and sinks, the annual FWC cycle seems primarily influenced by sea ice growth and melt. We have also applied the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to examine the FWC variability in Baffin Bay. THe first EOF represents 82.8% of the FWC's total variance and likely results from the melting of sea ice in central Baffin Bay and land runoff near coastal areas. Along the Baffin Island Current pathway, this mode appears to be predominantly driven by freshwater transport out of the bay associated with the current. The second mode, which accounts for 12.1% of the FWC's total variance, exhibits a heterogeneous spatial pattern, suggesting that various local physical forces such wind-ice stress and inflow of Atlantic Water have influence on it.

"The changed nature of the Arctic Ocean in high-resolution climate models"
..........................................................................
      High-resolution climate models can resolve more climate variability, including ocean eddies and climate extremes, which are projected to be more prominent with sea ice retreat. They are therefore important for studying the interactions of climate variability at different scales in the Arctic Ocean.
Although the meridional overturning circulation in high-resolution climate model shows a smooth weakening on a basin scale, there are abrupt shifts on regional scales only in the high-resolution model, such as a strengthening towards the Arctic. This is induced by resolved ocean eddies and boundary currents that increase the heterogeneity of density at ocean boundary, highlighting the disproportionate and interconnected cross-scale climate tipping points in high-resolution models.

      The Arctic marine heatwaves, as resolved in high-resolution climate models, would induce stronger future Arctic Ocean warming than current projections, as a feedback from the extreme events to the climate. We also identify an abrupt shift in the Arctic Ocean warming due to shifted Arctic sea ice and increased marine heatwaves in recent years, highlight the importance of increasing extremes in inducing climate transitions.

"Projecting future climate changes for the Salish Sea using high resolution downscaling"
........................................................................................
The Salish Sea, a marginal sea located and shared between British Columbia and Washington State, supports an active and diverse ecosystem in addition to the economic and recreational activities of nearly 9 million locals who live along its shores. Given the Salish Sea’s importance, future climate projections can provide useful information for how to manage the resources and services it provides in the years to come. Using the SalishSeaCast ocean model configuration, based on Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO), a historical period (1986-2005) is used to evaluate changes in the Salish Sea for the years 2046-2065 using the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) under two future climate scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (moderate mitigation) and RCP 8.5 (no mitigation). We find that the waters in the Salish Sea are becoming less dense, due to higher temperatures and a shift to lower salinities. In addition to the physical model, SalishSeaCast is run with biogeochemistry, with our focus being on three ecosystem stressors: temperature, oxygen, and ocean acidity. We identify regions in the Salish Sea that are more vulnerable to extreme conditions in the future using two different baselines.

"A comparison of two biogeochemical models, BLINGv0 and BiGCIIM, and their effectiveness in predicting productivity in a sub-Arctic region, the Hudson Bay Complex" 
...................................................................................................................................................................
As part of the BaySys project, an analysis and comparison of two simplified biogeochemical models, BLINGv0 and BiGCIIM, was done to assess their predictive capabilities of chlorophyll a in the Hudson Bay Complex (HBC). The two biogeochemical models were coupled with the NEMOv3.6 ocean circulation model and the LIM2 sea-ice model, with BLINGv0 representing only phosphate and iron-limited planktonic processes, while BiGCIIM includes nitrogen-limited planktonic and sea-ice biogeochemistry. The models were evaluated against observational and satellite data from 2003 to 2021, focusing on chlorophyll a concentrations as a proxy for productivity. BLINGv0 showed a better spatial representation of chlorophyll a concentrations, possibly due to its iron limitation constraint, while BiGCIIM performed better in localised areas, likely due to its explicit phytoplankton-type representation and light usage under ice. While both models share fundamental principles of nutrient and light limitation for growth, their responses to physical forcings and potential key drivers of variability differ due to their base currency and implementation of it. This highlights that both simplified biogeochemical models were sufficient to resolve spatial and temporal patterns no matter their currency, but investigation into region specific dynamics would need base currencies to be considered.

“The Role of Glacier Melt on Freshwater Dynamics in the Canadian Arctic”
........................................................................
Marine-terminating glaciers, numerous in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), are an important and dynamic source of freshwater to the Arctic freshwater system, with glacial inputs modifying local ocean properties and contributing to regional freshwater budgets. Despite their abundance, knowledge is lacking on glacier-ocean systems across the CAA, and these systems are often omitted in regional studies of freshwater transport or storage. In this study, we examine the nature and spatial extent of glacial meltwater influence on freshwater dynamics in Jones Sound, a glacier-rich region in the CAA, to better understand the contributions and of glacier meltwater to the regional oceanic freshwater system, the interannual variability of freshwater within Jones Sound, as well as the transport and export of freshwater from the region. We employ a high-resolution a coupled ocean and sea ice model of the Arctic and Northern Hemisphere Atlantic at 1/4 degree resolution to examine a regional freshwater storage and the freshwater budget of Jones Sound. Results show an accumulation of freshwater over the study period and changes in the freshwater budget: notably a decrease in magnitude of both the dominant source and sink of freshwater to the region. These changes to the local freshwater budget show glacier melt plays an increasingly prominent role in freshwater dynamics in Jones Sound.

"Efforts towards NEMO4 and development plans for a contribution to the NEMO consortium"
.......................................................................................
The Canadian Operational Network of Coupled Environmental Prediction Systems (CONCEPTS) has developed a suite of ocean prediction systems from global to coastal scales. They are all based on NEMO v3.6 coupled to CICE v4.0. This year, the system sea ice component was updated to CICE v6.2.0 and we are in the process of testing the v4.2.2 NEMO component. CICE6 finally offers dynamic array allocation and new physics such as mushy layer, and NEMO4 is expected to improve on the run time, new bulk formulae, turbulence below sea ice and offers new features such as wetting and drying. This presentation will show early results using NEMO4 and CICE6 at different scales and some of the challenges. We are also developing a plan for contributing to the NEMO consortium that I would like to share with you during this presentation and get feedbacks.

“Modelling of the Arctic Ocean and Labrador Sea at 1/60th Degree”
.................................................................
Our group has carried out simulations of the Labrador Sea at 1/60th and shown that very-high resolution significantly improves the model solution. That resolution, by representing the mesoscale and part of the sub-mesoscale significantly improves the simulation of boundary current system, eddies and shelf-basin exchange, with the small-scale processes combining to also improve the large-scale circulation and overturning. Given such improvements for the Labrador Sea, we now examine modelling the entire Arctic Ocean and the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean north of 53N latitude. The configuration is named ARC60. The experiment also includes an iceberg module and tidal forcing.
Here we present some of our ongoing analysis using the two very high resolution configurations. We explore questions related to water formation in the Labrador Sea and Greenland melt, behavior of the Labrador Current and the Deep Western Boundary Current. We also explore the impact of Greenland runoff on driving coastal seasonal features in Melville Bay. Finally we look at eddies and small scale processes in the Arctic Ocean and Beaufort Gyre.
