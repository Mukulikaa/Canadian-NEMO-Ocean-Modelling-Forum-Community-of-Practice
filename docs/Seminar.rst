Monthly Seminar Series
======================================

Each month we invite NEMO researchers and developers an opportunity to show their work in our seminar series. This takes place on zoom on the first monday of each month. If you are interested in presenting your work, please see the google page. See our calendar on the main page for the next speaker's abstract and zoom information. This page will provide past speakers of our seminar series.

"Baffin Bay Annual Freshwater Content and Budget" 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Baffin Bay significantly contributes to transporting and transforming freshwater from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, our understanding remains incomplete regarding the mechanisms involved in storing and dispersing of the this freshwater within the bay before it leaves through Davis Strait. In order to investigate the freshwater content (FWC) seasonal variability in Baffin Bay, we used NEMO 3.6 model coupled with The Louvain-La-Neuve sea ice model (LIM2) - 1/4ยบ horizontal spatial resolution. We have analyzed the FWC annual budget within Baffin Bay and determined that there is a surplus of freshwater into the bay from May to September, while there is a FWC decrease in the remaining months. After considering all sources and sinks, the annual FWC cycle seems primarily influenced by sea ice growth and melt. We have also applied the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to examine the FWC variability in Baffin Bay. THe first EOF represents 82.8% of the FWC's total variance and likely results from the melting of sea ice in central Baffin Bay and land runoff near coastal areas. Along the Baffin Island Current pathway, this mode appears to be predominantly driven by freshwater transport out of the bay associated with the current. The second mode, which accounts for 12.1% of the FWC's total variance, exhibits a heterogeneous spatial pattern, suggesting that various local physical forces such wind-ice stress and inflow of Atlantic Water have influence on it.

"The changed nature of the Arctic Ocean in high-resolution climate models"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      High-resolution climate models can resolve more climate variability, including ocean eddies and climate extremes, which are projected to be more prominent with sea ice retreat. They are therefore important for studying the interactions of climate variability at different scales in the Arctic Ocean.
Although the meridional overturning circulation in high-resolution climate model shows a smooth weakening on a basin scale, there are abrupt shifts on regional scales only in the high-resolution model, such as a strengthening towards the Arctic. This is induced by resolved ocean eddies and boundary currents that increase the heterogeneity of density at ocean boundary, highlighting the disproportionate and interconnected cross-scale climate tipping points in high-resolution models.

      The Arctic marine heatwaves, as resolved in high-resolution climate models, would induce stronger future Arctic Ocean warming than current projections, as a feedback from the extreme events to the climate. We also identify an abrupt shift in the Arctic Ocean warming due to shifted Arctic sea ice and increased marine heatwaves in recent years, highlight the importance of increasing extremes in inducing climate transitions.
